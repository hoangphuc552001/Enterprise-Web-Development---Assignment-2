Outstanding (90+)
Theme: Exceptional ability.

Features:

Backend persistence using new API endpoints - e.g. Favourites, Fantasy movie.
Rich feature set.
Assignment 1 integration.
Spec-Driven Development
You may choose to use the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach introduced in the final lab.

This approach involves:

writing a feature specification before implementation
generating a structured task plan
implementing features incrementally
validating the implementation against the spec
Using SDD is optional, but recommended for:

better planning
clearer feature design
more structured use of AI tools
If used, typical artifacts include:

specs/.../spec.md
specs/.../tasks.md
validation notes or evidence
These are not mandatory deliverables, but may strengthen your project.

Use of AI Tools (MANDATORY REQUIREMENT)
Any use of AI must be clearly documented in your repository and/or README.

Your documentation must include:

which AI tool(s) you used
what tasks the AI assisted with (e.g. coding, debugging, planning)
how you reviewed, edited, and validated the generated output
which parts of the final solution were significantly influenced by AI
AI should be used as a support tool, not as a substitute for understanding. Your chat histories are accessible and should be included in the repo of the submission in a text file for review

Critical Requirement
This is your code and you must be able to explain all code submitted in your assignment.

Any code, feature, component, pattern, or design decision that you cannot clearly explain and justify may result in a penalty in grading.

This includes:

AI-generated code copied without understanding
use of libraries or patterns that you cannot explain
features that appear to work but cannot be discussed in technical detail
Marks will reward:

understanding
correct implementation
appropriate design decisions
ability to explain how and why your solution works
